https://gstroop1690.shutterfly.com/


1) user/logins to get in
2) photo sharing.  uploading, downloading, browsing
3) calendar sharing.  Needs to show a calendar on the main site, as well as being able to focus on just calendar work.  nice if it can be optionall synced to google calendar and/or outlook.
4) blogging/messaging.  A running blog of announcements and comms.  Admins can send out emails?  need a way of keeping email lists.
5) admin portal:  see requested signups, manage users, maillists, etc.  rosters.  who has permission to modify the calendar, whatever.  So much easier if it could be sharepoint...  actually... it has to be login based anyway...
6) file browser.  folder based file sharing.
7) sign up sheets.  These are tables.
